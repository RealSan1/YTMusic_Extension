  <h1>Privacy Policy – YouTube Music Synced</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 4, 2025</p>

  <p>The "YouTube Music Synced" Chrome extension ("the extension") provides real-time lyrics display and playback control on YouTube Music. We prioritize your privacy, and this policy explains what data we collect and how it is used.</p>

    <li><strong>Playback Status:</strong> Whether the song is playing or paused.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is collected only from the YouTube Music page (https://music.youtube.com) and used for lyrics display and playback control.</p>

  <h2>2. Purpose of Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lyrics Display:</strong> Sends song info to the lrclib.net API to fetch synced lyrics.</li>
    <li><strong>Playback Control:</strong> Enables play, pause, seek, and track navigation from the popup UI.</li>
    <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Displays song info and synced lyrics in the popup to enhance usability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Information Sharing</h2>
  <p>The extension shares song information (title, artist, album) with the lrclib.net API to request lyrics.</p>
  <p>No personally identifiable information (such as name or email) is collected or shared.</p>
  <p>Data is not stored on any external server and is handled only within the browser session.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Collected data is temporarily stored in browser memory and is not saved to local storage or external servers.</p>
  <p>All data is deleted when the browser is closed.</p>

  <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
  <p>As no personally identifiable information is collected, data access or deletion requests do not apply.</p>
  <p>You may remove the extension at any time through Chrome Settings > Extensions > Remove to stop all data processing.</p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>

  <p>YouTube Music data is handled in accordance with YouTube’s policies.</p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>The extension collects minimal data and communicates with lrclib.net via secure HTTPS connections.</p>
  <p>No external scripts or unnecessary data handling are used.</p>
